**README.md**

This project provides a license plate detection and recognition system using YOLOv8. It captures video from your webcam, identifies license plates, and displays bounding boxes around them in real-time.

**Requirements**

* ultralytics (YOLOv8)
* opencv-python (for video capture)
* matplotlib (for visualization)
* roboflow (for dataset and model training)

**Installation**

1. **Install Requirements:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**Usage**

1. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   * Your webcam feed will open in a window titled "Webcam."
   * License plates will be highlighted with bounding boxes.
   * Confidence levels and the class name ("License Plate") will be printed to your console.
   * Press "q" to quit.

**Project Structure**

* **app.py:** The main application file to run.
* **license-Plate_detector.pt:** Your trained YOLOv8 license plate detection model (provided).

**Key Points**

* **Webcam Input:**  This app specifically uses your webcam as the video source.  You can modify the `cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)` line in `app.py` if you want to use a different camera or a video file.
* **Confidence Threshold:** Consider adjusting the confidence threshold in `app.py` if you're getting too many false positives or missing some plates.
* **Customization:** You can customize the appearance of the bounding boxes (color, thickness) and the displayed text (font, size) by modifying the `cv2.rectangle` and `cv2.putText` lines in `app.py`.

**Example Output**

[Image of webcam feed with license plates highlighted in bounding boxes] (If you have a sample image, include it here)

**Troubleshooting**

* **Camera Access:** If the webcam doesn't open, ensure your camera is working and not being used by another application.

Feel free to add any further details or screenshots if you have them. This README should be sufficient to guide users on how to run your project. Let me know if you have any other questions.
